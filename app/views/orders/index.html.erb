<h1>How Does This Work?</h1>
<p>We send you a booklet with all the information you need to throw one of our parties. That information is just for the hosts/moderators and contains all the spoilers in the world. You pick a time and a place and recruit a bunch of friends. You send each of them a small packet with the information needed to play a single character-- a single point of view in the greater plot. The hosts/moderators will have to find various props to give to the players on game day, and will decorate the playing space as much as is fun for them. The players will find costumes and show up on game day ready to do their individual devious deeds, or get thwarted in their attempts.</p>
<p>Speakeasy Games are built around <span class="w3-text-green">players</span> with incomplete knowledge and a <span class="w3-text-red">moderator</span> (or moderators) with full knowledge of the plot, players' goals, and mysteries of the universe.  <b class="w3-text-black">Only read the moderator packet if you are planning on being the moderator.</b>  Moderator packets will be delivered by e-mail. When checking out, make sure you use an email address that the <b class="w3-text-black">moderator</b> has access to.</p>
