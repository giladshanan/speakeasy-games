# The moderators The Silver of Burnt Grass should expect to spend at least a couple hours tracking down the appropriate props. Some, but not all, of this responsibility can be passed on to the players. The Silver of Burnt Grass uses an optional dueling mechanic that improves the game, but requires a fair amount of set-up. Little to no decoration is required, but the game is better in a suitably decorated space.
